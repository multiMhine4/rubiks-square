# The Rubik's Square

This is a simple simulator of a very simplified version of the Rubik's Cube---*a Rubik's Square*. It is merely for my own enjoyment as I have an ongoing interest in understanding how to solve the Rubik's Cube, not just follow established algorithms; I want to understand how someone could come up with them naturally. I wish to start from the simplest case possible and build up from there. Hence, this project was born.
